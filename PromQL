The below queries are based on the metrics outputted by my sample Scala app -> https://github.com/MarkVee87/ScalaAkkaHttp_StartingPoint

View the cumulative count of metrics per histogram bucket (le)
span_processing_time_seconds_bucket

View the increase of metrics per histogram bucket (le) during a give time period (duration)
increase(span_processing_time_seconds_bucket[duration])

View the 99th percentile response time during a give time period (duration)
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(span_processing_time_seconds_bucket[duration])) by (le))

View the average per-second rate of requests per second
rate(http_server_requests_total[2m])
